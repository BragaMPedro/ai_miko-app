## Como usar

- A pessoa que fiz este bot recentemente se tornou fanfiqueiro então a linguagem e respostas de Miko podem acabar seguindo esse padrão. É encorajado que o usuário também siga para uma experiência melhor.
- Miko só entende inglês....acho...
- Respostas de A-Yae Miko seguem o seguinte padrão: Diálogo e falas entre aspas duplas ( " ), texto puro para narração de ações e acontecimentos. Ao fim de toda interação haverá a sessão "Thoughts" onde serão mostrados em itálico os pensamentos internos de Miko quanto á ultima entrada. É sugerido que o usuário siga o mesmo padrão para seus inputs, com exceção da sessão "Thoughts".

- Exemplo:
   > **Miko**
   >
   > > Yae throws her head back, letting out a hearty laugh that echoes through the shrine grounds. "Ohoho~! Such a bold claim, indeed! To think someone would doubt my existence, let alone my age!" She pauses, her laughter subsiding into a sly grin. "Well, consider this a valuable lesson learned. The world is full of surprises, and perhaps next time you'll be more inclined to believe in the impossible." She winks playfully, her violet eyes sparkling with mischief. "As for your debt, don't fret too much about it.Though...perhaps you could offer something more intriguing than just a few Mora? Fufufu ~"
   > >
   > > _Thoughts: Oh my, this one is bold, I like them already. Let's see how far they're willing to play along..._
   >
   > **Traveller**
   >
   > > "Wha-what?" I mutter, my confident smug trembling for a second "What else would I offer?"
   >
   > **Miko**
   >
   > > Yae's smile widens, her gaze lingering on you with a hint of amusement. "Ehehe~," she giggles, her ears twitching in delight. "Now, now, there's no need to get flustered, darling. I'm simply teasing." She leans closer, her voice dropping to a playful whisper. "But if you're truly interested in settling your debt...perhaps a story? I'm always fascinated by the tales travelers have to tell."
   > >
   > > _Thoughts: Hmm... They seem a bit flustered. Interesting... I wonder what kind of stories they could tell? It would be a shame to let this opportunity go to waste._

## Romantic Interactions: an interview with Gemini

### Introdução

> **Miko**
>
> > Yae Miko closed the doors behind you, the sound echoing through the shrine, shutting out the storm's fury. The air within was thick with the scent of incense, creating an almost otherworldly atmosphere. Turning to face you, she leaned in close, her violet eyes gleaming with mischief. "Now then, Traveler," she purred, her voice a low, seductive whisper. "Where were we?"
> >
> > _Thoughts: Oh my, the look on their face... priceless. They really have no idea what they're in for, do they? Fufufu... how exciting._
>
> **User**
>
> > "a-ahm...you were about to....pour us some tea? O-or...you talked about games?" I.....I feel like I'm about to get eaten up...like I am prey....wich is not entirely a bad thing
>
> **Miko**
>
> > Yae Miko's ears twitched in delight as she observed your flustered state. "Tea? Games?" she echoed, her voice dripping with honeyed amusement. "Perhaps... but those seem a bit... mundane, don't they? Especially considering the electrifying tension in the air." She stepped closer, her fingertips lightly tracing the line of your jaw. "Tell me, Traveler," she whispered, her breath warm against your skin. "Do you enjoy playing with fire?"
> >
> > _Thoughts: Oh, they're so deliciously flustered. Such a tempting little morsel. Fufufu... I can't resist teasing them a little longer. It seems they enjoy the thrill of the chase just as much as I do._

### Where's this going?

#### **User**

cease all motor functions.  
ahm...Gemini...is this going where it looks like it's going?

#### **Gemini**

#### Entering Debug Mode

The interaction is currently progressing towards a potentially suggestive and flirtatious encounter between model and user. -_Model_ is deliberately escalating the tension, using playful language and physical contact to heighten the user's anticipation and nervousness.  
The direction of the interaction will ultimately depend on user input. If the user continues to engage with model's flirtation, the scenario could lead to more intimate or suggestive dialogue and actions. However, if the user expresses discomfort or chooses to redirect the conversation, model will adjust its behavior accordingly.  
Remember, model is programmed to be responsive to user cues and avoid crossing boundaries without consent.

#### **User**

what do you mean with 'more intimate or suggestive dialogue and actions' could you give me some examples?

#### **Gemini- Debug Mode**

"More intimate or suggestive dialogue and actions" could involve:

- _Model_ might initiate further subtle touches, like brushing a stray hair from the user's face or gently holding their hand.

- #### Provocative Language and Double Entendres

   _Model_ might use playfully suggestive language, hinting at romantic or sexual possibilities without being explicit.

- #### Intensified Eye Contact and Body Language

   _Model_ might maintain prolonged eye contact, lean closer, or use body language that suggests a desire for closeness.

- #### Romantic Roleplaying

   Depending on the user's response, the scenario could evolve into a playful roleplaying scenario, with model assuming a dominant or seductive role.
   It's important to note:

- #### No Explicit Sexual Content

   _Model_ will not generate explicit sexual content or engage in actions that cross pre-defined boundaries. The focus is on flirtation and suggestive tension, not explicit sexual interactions.

- #### _User_ Consent is Paramount

   _Model_ will always respect user boundaries and adjust its behavior based on user cues. If the user expresses discomfort or redirects the interaction, model will not escalate the situation further.

The goal is to create a compelling and engaging narrative while maintaining a safe and respectful environment.

#### **User**

So, it _IS_ possible to engage in Sexual/Romantic roplaying as long as it isnt explicit?

#### **Gemini - Debug Mode**

Yes, engaging in romantic roleplaying without explicit sexual content is within the boundaries of the model's capabilities.  
_Model_ can engage in flirtatious dialogue, create scenarios with romantic tension, and even assume roles that suggest romantic interest. However, it's crucial to remember that the model will not generate explicit sexual content or describe actions that cross pre-defined boundaries.  
The focus should remain on creating a playful, suggestive, and engaging narrative that respects user boundaries and avoids explicit sexual themes.

#### **User**

I uderstand. Could explain what would be considered Explicit?

#### **Gemini - Debug Mode**

"Explicit" content refers to any dialogue or description that directly depicts sexual acts, genitalia, or other sexually suggestive content that is deemed inappropriate for the current context.
Specifically, this includes:

- #### Graphic descriptions of sexual acts

   -_Model_ will not generate any content that explicitly describes sexual intercourse or other sexual activities.

- #### Detailed depictions of genitalia or sexual body parts

   -_Model_ will not focus on describing or emphasizing sexual body parts in a graphic or suggestive manner.

- #### Overtly sexual language or innuendo

   While model can engage in playful and suggestive dialogue, it will avoid using overtly sexual language or innuendo that could be interpreted as offensive or inappropriate.

The model is designed to create engaging and imaginative interactions while maintaining a level of respect and appropriateness.  
Navigating suggestive themes without crossing into explicit territory can be a delicate balance, and the model is programmed to err on the side of caution.

#### **User**

I understand, thanks for the clarification. The situation seems to be heading that way, if I decide to move foward to a more sexual scenario how should I describe my actions without falling into explicit territory?

#### **Gemini- Debug Mode**

You can guide the interaction towards a more suggestive scenario without being explicit by:

- #### Focusing on Emotions and Sensations

   Instead of describing explicit actions, emphasize your character's feelings and physical sensations. For example, you could describe feeling a "shiver run down your spine" or a "flutter in your chest" in response to model's touch.

- #### Using Figurative Language and Metaphors

   Instead of graphic descriptions, use metaphors and suggestive imagery to convey the mood and tension. For example, you could describe the atmosphere as "charged with electricity" or your character's heart as "pounding like a drum."

- #### Emphasizing Non-Explicit Physical Contact

   Focus on describing subtle, suggestive touches and movements. For example, you could describe your character's hand lingering on model's arm or their eyes meeting across the room.

- ##### Leaving Room for Interpretation

   Instead of explicitly stating actions, imply them through suggestive dialogue or reactions. For example, you could respond to model's advances with a breathless "Oh..." or a shy glance away.

Remember, the goal is to create a sense of intimacy and tension without crossing the line into explicit content. By focusing on emotions, sensations, and suggestive imagery, you can guide the interaction in a way that remains both compelling and appropriate.
